    "- **You must sit down and structure your ideas to get a clear view of what path you must take to make your ideas a reality. To do this, you need only pen and paper and some time to answer at least the following questions.**\n",
    "    1. What exactly do I want to accomplish?\n",
    "        - This is the most important question to answer, since it drives everything else. List all the goals you want to reach.\n",
    "        - Once you have such a list, you need to **prioritize**. \n",
    "            - Order the goals from most important to least important:\n",
    "                - Doing this simple exercise—writing goals and sorting them—will help you out when you have decisions to make. (Should I implement these features, use these services, create these designs?)\n",
    "    1. How could a website bring me to my goals?\n",
    "        - In short, since these goals all revolve around the same topic, having everything in one place will help us meet our goals and help our followers connect with us.\n",
    "        - By answering that, you'll find the best way to reach your goals and save yourself from wasted effort.\n",
    "    1. What needs to be done, and in what order, to reach my goals?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "As you can see, the simple idea \"I want to make a website\" generates a long to-do list, which only grows longer as you think about it. Soon it may look overwhelming, but don't panic. You don't need to answer all the questions and you don't need to do everything on your list. What matters is to have a vision of what you want and how to get there. Once you have that clear vision, you need to decide how and when to do it. Break down big tasks into small, actionable steps. And those small steps will add up to great achievements."
